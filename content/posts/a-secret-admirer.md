[![Screenshot of an email that says hey](/img/Screenshot.png)](/img/Screenshot.png)

**Hmmmmm**

So it seems that one of my readers has taken advantage of my email being posted on this site...

Today at 5:34 pm, I got an email (from an address I have the dignity not to expose on my uber-popular blog) with the body text "Hey" and a winky face emoji...

*Really!?*

I mean yes, I'm flattered. But can't you see I'm running a totally legit operation here? I don't think it's quite appropriate to be sending me such a message. You even signed the email "Secret Admirer."

I just don't know if I'm ready to move on from Michael yet. Especially not with some internet rando!! Please don't take this too hard, but I must say the feelings are *not* reciprocated. I will be involving my lawyer if this keeps up.
