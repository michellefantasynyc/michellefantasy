In many ways after my husband’s strange and untimely death, **I was lost.** I struggled to find meaning and purpose in my life without Michael by my side. To make matters worse, I was _consistently_ accused of murdering him. (just because he had strychnine in his system doesn’t mean there was foul play).

Regardless, I was struggling. I needed something but I didn’t know what. On one of my late night Craigslist scrolls, I came across an ad for a live-in farm hand. It offered a place to sleep, food, and a mediocre pay. I was quick to inquire.

**I was the only one to reply.** Maybe it was because the farm was in the secluded Colorado mountains or the advertisers seemed like bad people. Regardless, I quickly got a response and I was hired sight unseen. Oh joy!

My happiness quickly disappeared as I remember my other half wouldn’t be around to share this with me. I toiled with the idea for many nights, wondering what to do, when I remembered a mantra I made up: “Just do it.” So I did.

I packed up all the things I needed and put the rest into storage. I got aboard a plane and set off to start a new chapter in my life.

Whatever they tell you about Colorado is **wrong**. It sucks!! Before I even landed, I learned from the flight attendant that all of the checked suitcases fell from the plane somewhere over the front range and I could say goodbye to my precious keepsakes. When I landed, the baby that had been crying next to me the entire flight threw up all over me. Then, as I waited for my uber a dog peed on my shoe. Just my luck.

Nonetheless, I was _still_ determined to keep a positive attitude. 

From the airport, I was picked up by the farm family. All seven of them and myself crammed into their minivan and began our trip to the farm. Teebow, the father and ad-poster, greeted me. His mouth was gummy without a single tooth and his hairline receded past my line of sight. He shook my hand so aggressively and painfully and **I was regretting my decision.**

During the four hour car ride, Thomas, Bralynn, Puttley, and Rye were crying and yelling at each other while I felt every bump in the trunk. (That was the only place I could fit). From the back of that car on twisting mountain roads, I yearned for Michael. Had I made a mistake? Would the next three months be a living hell? It was too late to turn back.

During that drive, I wondered who I was. What does it mean for a person to live again after they lose the one they lived for? I asked what it would be like to live for _**Michelle**_ and not Michael for the first time since we got married. Reaching no meaningful conclusion, the drive carried on.

When we finally got to the farm, I was feeling no better. The unkempt dirt road didn’t do my motion sickness any favors either. I was shown to my room and set my stuff down before joining the family for dinner. Roast beef and egg milk. It was gross. 

After dinner I retreated to my room. I wanted to roll over and give up. I didn’t think I could do it without my dear Michael. 

Despite my worries, sleep came. In the morning **I began my first day of work.** 

The work was worse than anything else. I rose at 6:00 am, tended to the animals and fields, only taking breaks to eat and sleep when I stopped work at 10:00 pm. My least favorite job was feeding the newest kid, Pingus. 

Pingus was an _evil_ baby. Pingus would spit up any food no matter what unless it was fed to him like a mother bird feeds her kids. Who do you think was in charge of doing that? **Me.**

After feeding Pingus, I would go to my room and sob. It reminded me of Michael and how he would do that to the peacock that roamed around our neighborhood. Who was I to assume that role? I was not content and I felt much worse off than before taking this job.

These horrible days continued on for **weeks**. Wake up, eat, feed Pingus, work, eat, feed Pingus, work, eat, feed Pingus, sleep. It was a never-ending cycle. 

**But all of that changed one day.** One of the farm’s cows, Plit, got worms. Plit was a sweet baby but the nature of my work never permitted me much of a relationship with her. However, once she got worms, I was in charge of getting rid of them.

Every day, after I ate lunch and fed Pingus, I would head down to the barn and give Plit an oral solution alongside some injectable medicine. At first, she hated it. The solution must’ve tasted horrible and I’m sure the huge cow needle was no fun either. 

As embarrassing as it sounds, I saw myself in Plit. She too was a lady who’d fallen upon hard times. I knew it was my job to help her out of this. Rain or shine, I showed up for Plit and gave her the meds then sat with her for 20 minutes to make sure she didn’t spit them up. 

Over time, **I saw her get better.** She started getting excited when I came into the barn because she knew she had a friend to hang out with. I felt the same way. I looked forward to this exchange because I felt I could escape the real world. 

​​Eventually, those twenty minutes stretched into thirty, then an hour. Sometimes I would bring my book and hide away with her, and sometimes I would just hum little songs to her. If I was feeling brave, I would rest my head against Plit’s side and listen to her breathing.

I noticed myself beginning to wake up early and do my work quickly in order to see Plit sooner. I fed Pingus quickly and with care so I could hop on over to the barn and deworm the lady. 

In the midst of this great big friendship, **I stopped worrying so much.** I didn’t suffer from those existential thoughts in the morning like I used to. I sprang up and smiled at Michelle as I brushed my teeth in the mirror. 

**While I feel deeply sorry for what I put Michael through, the experience brought me closer to sweet Plit and even myself.** 

After some time helping that sweet girl get rid of her worms, my help was no longer needed. It was a sad affair to stop seeing her so regularly, but I still found time to say hello during my busy days. 

After a summer spent working hard, eating weird things, and deworming cows, I would be lying if I said I unlocked the key to life. I didn’t. I’m not leaving the farm with any deeper or mature understanding of the world. But I am leaving with a better understanding of Michelle. 

Throughout my relationship with Michael, I cared for him in a similar way that I cared for Plit. When he got worms, I was the one helping him flush them out. In his absence, I realized that the thing I was missing was someone to care for. At the end of the day, I’m only ever content if those around me are in good health. 

On my last morning, the family loaded me back into the minivan to go to the bus stop. They didn’t care to drive me to the airport this time. As we drove down the dirt road, Teebow slapped me on the back. I think it was his way of saying thank you but oh my god it hurt so bad.

**Teebow and his strange family waved me goodbye as I left that horrible farm. I waved too and shed a tear as I saw Plit try to come running after me.**

I am now writing this on the bus from the mountains to Denver. When I arrive in Denver, I’ll travel to a suburb to spend a few nights before my flight back to New York. The flight should be easy as I lost all my luggage on the flight out here. 

XOXO,

**Michelle**
