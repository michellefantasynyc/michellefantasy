[![Bold Letter that spell out Michelle Fantasy NYC](/img/MFN.pdf)](/img/MFN.pdf)

# Hello!

I hate to say it, but towards the end of his time here, Michael and I were not getting along. Marriages fluctuate, everyone knows that; but it was crazy!

We’d fight all day long, only taking breaks to eat before quickly returning to our arguments. At night time we’d sleep in separate rooms to let our sanity return before tomorrow's battles…

However, now that my hubby is gone, I don’t know what to fill my day with!

Arguing became a ritual for me, and dare I say… I began to look forward to it. It gave me something interesting to do and I’m lost without it. Funny how things work out like this.

Who am I? Damned to assume the role of a bored housewife. Ex-housewife?? Widow???? Surely there must be something more interesting to do with my time. 

I decided to turn over a new leaf in life. I’ve moved in with some late teenage college kids in Brooklyn. We don’t get along. I worry that this may have been a mistake!! 

\-Michelle 

P.S. to those saying I killed my husband. There is no proof!!!!
