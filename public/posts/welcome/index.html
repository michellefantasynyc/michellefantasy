<h1 id="hello">Hello!</h1>
<p>I hate to say it, but towards the end of his time here, Michael and I were not getting along. Marriages fluctuate, everyone knows that; but it was crazy!</p>
<p>We’d fight all day long, only taking breaks to eat before quickly returning to our arguments. At night time we’d sleep in separate rooms to let our sanity return before tomorrow&rsquo;s battles…</p>
<p>However, now that my hubby is gone, I don’t know what to fill my day with!</p>
<p>Arguing became a ritual for me, and dare I say… I began to look forward to it. It gave me something interesting to do and I’m lost without it. Funny how things work out like this.</p>
<p>Who am I? Damned to assume the role of a bored housewife. Ex-housewife?? Widow???? Surely there must be something more interesting to do with my time. </p>
<p>I decided to turn over a new leaf in life. I’ve moved in with some late teenage college kids in Brooklyn. We don’t get along. I worry that this may have been a mistake!! </p>
<p>-Michelle </p>
<p>P.S. to those saying I killed my husband. There is no proof!!!!</p>
